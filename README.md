# MANA Stats

**MANA Stats** is a web application that provides a leaderboard and a heatmap based on subgraphs of Decentraland data. The platform allows users to explore land ownership and pricing trends in the Decentraland virtual world, gaining insights into land values and activities.

## Features

- **Leaderboard**: Displays the top landowners in Decentraland, ranked by various metrics such as land area owned, transaction volume, and more.
  
- **Heatmap**: Visualizes land pricing data across different coordinates. Users can quickly identify high-value land areas by analyzing price distribution trends across the virtual world.

- **Subgraph-powered Analytics**: The application leverages TheGraph protocol and Decentraland subgraphs to pull real-time data on land sales, ownership, and pricing trends.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: Used to build the interactive and dynamic UI.
  
- **D3.js**: For rendering the heatmap, visualizing land data across different coordinates.

- **The Graph & GraphQL**: To query Decentraland data from custom subgraphs.

- **Vercel**: For fast deployment and hosting of the application.
